# Python_codes
The program will prompt you for input: "Enter encoded words separated by semicolons."
Enter a string of encoded words separated by semicolons, e.g., kcjaelapp;janab;shruka.

After entering the input, the program processes the encoded words and tries to decode them based on the words in the dictionary and the rules.
The output will be as follows: "Decoded words: applejack;Not found;Not found" (in this case, if the dictionary contains the word "applejack", but does not contain words that correspond to "janab" and "shruka").
